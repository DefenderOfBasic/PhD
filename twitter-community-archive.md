# Twitter Community Archive

This is a project to (1) collect twitter archives from volunteers to study ourselves (2) build open source tools for collection & analysis so that other communities can reproduce this work on their own data. 

I started this project in July 2024 with [Xiq](https://x.com/exgenesis). It currently has 4 million tweets from 187 accounts.

### Visualizing word occurrences over time

App link: https://labs-community-archive.streamlit.app/

This is a "ngram viewer" over the corpus of the collected tweets. It's very useful to see how language unique to a specific community has evolved over time. For example, most of the people in the archive belong to a community called "tpot". It wasn't always called that. At some point it was called "ingroup", and/or "postrat" (short for post rationalist).
