# Defender's PhD

Pursuing independent research in "sociocultural technology". My current focus is developing experimental techniques, documenting them, and carrying out experiments to corroborate or falsify theories. See: [list of people I believe are in this field](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/PhD/issues/2).

My background is in computer science & math. I worked in tech for 6 years (geospatial software). 

### 📜 Research statement

The behavior of groups of humans can be predicted with great precision. Private entities that have a lot of data about people can already do this. We should study this in the open so we can protect ourselves, and also because we'll have much better data, and much better models. This will help us align our incentives with those with power, or confirm it's not possible, and instead find & cooperate with the groups who are aligned with us.

> solve cooperation, use it to solve everything else - @IvanVendrov

My top priority is figuring out how to study, predict, and engineer our culture safely. I'm doing this work 100% in the open for this reason.

### 🧭 Long term vision

If I can do a good job learning, writing as I go, getting feedback from researchers on the internet, and eventually publishing something novel & useful, I can get an endorsement from people with academic credentials. My reward would be status, that I can use to further my career as a researcher, or hold a position in a corporation furthering this work.

I want to contribute to a world where all tribes on earth have access to tools to study themselves, safely in private if needed, and to signal what they want to signal publicly about themselves. We would see culture as open source, art is forked & remixed, not frozen by copyright. 

Our culture is open source & needs ongoing maintenance.
