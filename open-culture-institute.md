# Open Culture Institute

> I need something in between the Russian troll farms @bennjordan described, and like, a public research lab. An "open culture institute" that A/B tests people and publishes the result, for the general public

### Aella

Aella does this work very explicitly (1) rigorous surveys & publishing the results for the public (2) intentionally vocal about fixing bugs in culture, questioning the source of stigma & reframing narratives for public good

> Fwiw I'm a sex worker and also widely hated by the far right but also have severe issues with academia and how PhDs like this work. Just wanted to register the displeasure in the system is not just a far right thing!
