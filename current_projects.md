# Current projects

These are current directions I'm actively pursuing.

### Twitter community archive

https://www.community-archive.org/

A project to ask users to export & share their data as part of a public archive, so that anyone can study it. I wrote about ["visualizing how ideas spread"](https://github.com/TheExGenesis/community-archive/wiki/Exploring-historical-trends-in-the-community-archive) with a google-trends like app on this data.

My initial plan was to just publish my own archive, study it to see how & why I changed significantly over a span of ~1 year as I was exposed to specific ideas. This is kind of a very invasive analysis, but I thought that doing it on myself for the public good would be the easiest way to get permission, and that if I find something useful or interesting for myself, others might do it too. And if there is anything dangerous about it, others will see that too. Either way it will contribute to the field.

### Create empirical maps of discourse with LLM's semantic embeddings

See [twitter thread with examples](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1856002128327643289).

This gives us a rigorous answer to things like "does our culture think capitalism is more evil than communism?" There is an empirical answer to this question. You can create this map with with semantic embeddings.

The missing piece is that, this gives you the aggregate. I want different tribes to take this quiz, to map out what _they_ think it should be. The reality is there are large groups who would say the concept of "capitalism" is much closer to "evil" than communism. I want to build these conceptual maps that are specific to different tribes, because they let us identify (1) exactly in what way do people see a different reality (2) exactly what is our common ground 

### Communal culture science

I want to create tools or a platform for people to (1) ask an interesting question (2) collect data, and choose whether to publish it or keep it private within participants (3) for anyone to fork and repro the study.

Aella does this a lot, but I want this to somehow be easier, more common of a pattern. Like the [communal daily plot](https://perthirtysix.com/communal-plot-daily-poll) but in a way I can fork or submit questions?  

This is partially about creating the tech tools and partially about spreading that idea that anyone can do this, you can analyze other people's data, etc.

### IRL cultural experiments

It is not typical in the culture where I live for friends to "just stop by" your house without calling first. But I can change this with agreement with my friends, then if it works, we can write about it. Does it spread? What about "friendship breakups" ? and normalizing "saying no"? Can we just find all the bottlenecks in our local culture and fix them? And then do "cultural peer review" on the internet? 

On normalizing talking to people at coffee shops:

> this is incredible. my secret plan is to collect stories like this, get people to try it, if it works for many people & communities independently, it spreads. Cultural peer review
