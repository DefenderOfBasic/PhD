# Current projects

These are current directions I'm actively pursuing.

### Twitter community archive

https://www.community-archive.org/

A project to ask users to export & share their data as part of a public archive, so that anyone can study it. I wrote about ["visualizing how ideas spread"](https://github.com/TheExGenesis/community-archive/wiki/Exploring-historical-trends-in-the-community-archive) with a google-trends like app on this data.

My initial plan was to just publish my own archive, study it to see how & why I changed significantly over a span of ~1 year as I was exposed to specific ideas. This is kind of a very invasive analysis, but I thought that doing it on myself for the public good would be the easiest way to get permission, and that if I find something useful or interesting for myself, others might do it too. And if there is anything dangerous about it, others will see that too. Either way it will contribute to the field.
