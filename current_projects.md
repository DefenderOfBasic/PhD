# Current projects

These are current directions I'm actively pursuing.

### Twitter community archive

https://www.community-archive.org/

A project to ask users to export & share their data as part of a public archive, so that anyone can study it. I wrote about ["visualizing how ideas spread"](https://github.com/TheExGenesis/community-archive/wiki/Exploring-historical-trends-in-the-community-archive) with a google-trends like app on this data.

My initial plan was to just publish my own archive, study it to see how & why I changed significantly over a span of ~1 year as I was exposed to specific ideas. This is kind of a very invasive analysis, but I thought that doing it on myself for the public good would be the easiest way to get permission, and that if I find something useful or interesting for myself, others might do it too. And if there is anything dangerous about it, others will see that too. Either way it will contribute to the field.

### Create empirical maps of discourse with LLM's semantic embeddings

See [twitter thread with examples](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1856002128327643289).

This gives us a rigorous answer to things like "does our culture think capitalism is more evil than communism?" There is an empirical answer to this question. You can create this map with with semantic embeddings.

The missing piece is that, this gives you the aggregate. I want different tribes to take this quiz, to map out what _they_ think it should be. The reality is there are large groups who would say the concept of "capitalism" is much closer to "evil" than communism. I want to build these conceptual maps that are specific to different tribes, because they let us identify (1) exactly in what way do people see a different reality (2) exactly what is our common ground
